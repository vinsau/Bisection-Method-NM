# Bisection Method Calculator 
A simple console-based C++ program that automatically finds the root of any equation using the **Bisection Method**.

## How It Works
The Bisection Method is a numerical method used to find the root of an equation by repeatedly dividing an interval into two halves and selecting the subinterval where the root lies.

### Steps:
1. Automatically detects the interval `[a, b]` where the root lies.
2. Iteratively halves the interval.
3. Stops when the result is within the desired accuracy (**tolerance**).
4. Displays each iteration's values along with the approximate root.

## How to Use
1. Open the `main.cpp` file.
2. Go to the `double f(double x)` function.
3. Replace the equation inside with your own equation.

Example:
```cpp
// Replace this function with your own equation
double f(double x) {
    return (x * x * x) - 4*x - 9;  // Your equation here
}
```

4. Compile the code using g++ (if you're on Linux or WSL):
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o bisection
./bisection
```

5. The program will automatically find the interval `[a, b]` and display each iteration until the root is found.

## Things to Remember
- Your equation **must be continuous** in the given interval.
- The initial guess is automatically generated by the program.
- The root is only found if the signs of `f(a)` and `f(b)` are opposite.
